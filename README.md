# Textalk Arbetsprov
Started out with AngularJS-Boilerplate, removed a bunch of stuff I don't need, and finally landed on some niceties that I think made it an interesting visual design. Fun little project! :)

# Setup
Run ```npm install && bower install``` in your console from the project directory (assuming you have the dependencies)
- install all dependencies

# Start webapp
To start the app, run ```gulp``` in your console from the project directory(this assumes you have gulp installed and globally accessible)
- all SCSS/HTML will be watched for changes and injected into browser thanks to BrowserSync
